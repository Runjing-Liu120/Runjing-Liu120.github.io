# Runjing (Bryan) Liu

I am currently a third year PhD student in the [U.C. Berkeley Statistics Department](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/). I am advised by [Jon McAuliffe](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/jon-mcauliffe-0). I graduated from Duke University in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics. 

I am grateful to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
