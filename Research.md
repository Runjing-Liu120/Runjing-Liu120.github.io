# Research

My research focuses on approximate Bayesian inference. 

My primary application domain lies in variational inference for 
large-scale astronomicy datasets. A current project involves deep generative modeling for telescope images of galaxies. I combine ideas from deep learning, Bayesian probabilistic modeling, and physics knowledge for the detection of gravitational lensing. 

I also work on methods for efficient computation of Bayesian sensitivity to prior specifications in the context of variational inference.
